## Purpose
- Monitor player velocity and compare against allowed maximum speeds.
- Detect anomalies in running or driving speeds.
- Implement server-side checks to confirm reported speeds.

## Key Points
- Use GetEntitySpeed for velocity checks.
- Compare speeds with known vehicle/ped maximums.
- Document fallback detections for unusual edge cases.
